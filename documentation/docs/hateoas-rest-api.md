### HATEOAS in a REST API

Implementing HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) in a REST API involves adding links to resources
returned from your API endpoints.
These links provide clients with navigation options and improve the discoverability of related resources.

## Overview

When implementing HATEOAS in a REST API, each resource representation includes links to related resources or actions
that clients can take next. This allows clients to navigate the API dynamically without having prior knowledge of all
available endpoints.

## Steps to Implement HATEOAS

1. Include Dependencies

Ensure your project includes libraries or frameworks that support HATEOAS. For example, in Spring Boot with Spring
HATEOAS:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-hateoas</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Define Resource Classes

```java
import org.springframework.hateoas.RepresentationModel;

public class StudentResource extends RepresentationModel<StudentResource> {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    // Other attributes

    // Getters and setters
}
```

3. Controller Method Implementation
   In your controller methods, construct resource representations and add links using -**ControllerLinkBuilder**

```java
import org.springframework.hateoas.Link;
import org.springframework.hateoas.server.mvc.ControllerLinkBuilder;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/students")
public class StudentController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<StudentResource> getStudentById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Retrieve student by id
        Student student = studentService.findById(id);

        // Create StudentResource and add self link
        StudentResource studentResource = new StudentResource();
        studentResource.setId(student.getId());
        studentResource.setName(student.getName());

        Link selfLink = ControllerLinkBuilder.linkTo(StudentController.class)
                .slash(student.getId())
                .withSelfRel();
        studentResource.add(selfLink);

        // Add other links as needed

        return ResponseEntity.ok(studentResource);
    }
}
```

4. Generating Links
   Use ControllerLinkBuilder methods to generate links based on controller methods or resource paths. For example:

```java
Link selfLink = ControllerLinkBuilder.linkTo(methodOn(StudentController.class).getStudentById(student.getId()))
        .withSelfRel();
```

5. Testing and Validation
   Test your API endpoints to ensure that resource representations include correct links and adhere to HATEOAS
   principles.

## Benefits of HATEOAS

- **Discoverability**: Clients can navigate API resources dynamically without hardcoding URLs.
- **Flexibility**: Allows API changes without impacting clients that rely on links.
- **Standardization**: Promotes standard practices for API design and interaction.
